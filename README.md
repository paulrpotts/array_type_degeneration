# array_type_degeneration
Several files of C code for readers of my article "On Degeneration of Array Types in C."

See [the article](https://thepottshouse.org/paul/portfolio/On_Degeneration_of_Array_Types_in_C.html) for more information.

This code is here for you to learn from and experiment with. Follow along in the article, which links to these files. Try un-commenting-out sections, compiling and running the sections, stepping through the loops using your favorite debugger, etc.
